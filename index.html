            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence began with a strong curiosity about how machines could mimic human intelligence. Over the past four years, I have worked passionately as a researcher and developer, contributing to innovative projects in natural language processing, computer vision, and distributed computing. My academic foundation, with a Master’s degree in Computer Science and a 3.9 GPA from the University of North Carolina Greensboro, has been instrumental in shaping my technical and analytical skills. From pioneering AI solutions for clinical studies to creating advanced 3D roof reconstruction systems, my career reflects a blend of creativity, dedication, and problem-solving excellence. I am driven to explore the frontiers of technology and bring impactful solutions to real-world challenges.
