        <h3>Machine Learning Engineer - Freelancer | Omdena, Remote</h3>
        <p>From August 2024 to December 2024, I worked as a freelancer for Omdena, where I contributed to several projects involving 3D image reconstruction for industrial roofs. One of my key tasks was manually adjusting point cloud data using aerial datasets from the IECO website. This task was not only technical but also required a deep understanding of 3D data processing techniques to achieve accurate and reliable results.</p>
        <p>I also worked with cutting-edge architectures such as Neural Radiance Fields and PointNet to enhance the 3D roof reconstruction process. Integrating YOLOv11 for object detection and the Segment Anything Model-2 for segmentation tasks was particularly challenging, as it required combining two complex models and fine-tuning them for a specific task. This hands-on experience helped me refine my skills in advanced computer vision techniques and gave me a deeper appreciation for real-world application challenges in machine learning.</p>

        <h3>NLP Researcher | Clinical NLP Lab, Greensboro, NC, USA</h3>
        <p>From September 2023 to July 2024, I worked as an NLP Researcher at the Clinical NLP Lab under the mentorship of Dr. Yingcheng Sun. My main focus was on developing a Chroma Vector database for medical concept mapping tasks, which I deployed on Google Cloud Platform to improve search efficiency. I also fine-tuned GPT-3.5 turbo for concept mapping tasks using datasets like OHDSI and UMLS. This work significantly improved the performance of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques.</p>
        <p>The biggest challenge was enhancing RAG's performance, which required exploring multiple query strategies and integrating advanced reranking methods such as Cohere and Flash reranking. Despite these challenges, I successfully boosted efficiency by 20%, which directly impacted the effectiveness of our clinical study recruitment process.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I had the privilege of participating in prestigious conferences like NVIDIA GTC 2024 and the STEM Conference at Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI). I was also honored to receive the Dorothy Munroe Research Grant from the National Institute of Health, which supported my ongoing work in medical NLP research.</p>

        <h3>AI Intern | Atrium Health Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston Salem, NC, USA</h3>
        <p>From May 2023 to August 2023, I worked as an AI Intern at Atrium Health Wake Forest School of Medicine, focusing on building a web application to convert whole-slide pathology images into 512x512 patches. This tool saved time for co-workers by automating the patching process, which was crucial for large-scale medical image analysis.</p>
        <p>My work also involved training a Multi Instance Learning (MIL) model to identify positive bags for colon tumor presence. The challenge here was handling the complexity of pathological data and ensuring the model's accuracy in detecting subtle signs of tumors. Additionally, I fine-tuned segmentation models like UNET and Mask R-CNN, gaining valuable experience with training models on high-performance GPUs.</p>
        <p>Our research was published at the SPIE Medical Imaging Conference, showcasing the impact of our work on the medical imaging community.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>3D Convolutional Model Training on Lung CT Scan Images</h3>
        <p>This project aimed at training a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) on lung CT scan images to detect abnormalities such as tumors. The process involved multiple stages, from preprocessing the 3D CT scan images to training the CNN model and evaluating its performance.</p>
        <p>To begin, I collected and preprocessed a dataset of CT scan images, ensuring that the data was correctly formatted for 3D convolution. I employed data augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset, which was crucial due to the limited availability of medical data.</p>
        <p>The most challenging part was managing the complexity of 3D data. Unlike 2D images, 3D CT scans required significant computational power and memory. I overcame these challenges by using batch processing and optimizing the architecture of the CNN for better efficiency. I also had to carefully tune hyperparameters to achieve acceptable performance levels, balancing precision and recall to minimize false negatives in tumor detection.</p>
        <p>Throughout the process, I gained a deeper understanding of the nuances of medical image processing and the unique challenges involved in training models on volumetric data. This experience has strengthened my skills in working with complex data and optimizing deep learning models for practical applications in medical fields.</p>

        <h3>Feature Analysis with Multimodal Model (IdeficsForVisionText2Text) using NASA HiRISE Data</h3>
        <p>In this project, I applied image processing techniques like normalization, resizing, and contrast adjustment to NASA's HiRISE dataset, which is used to analyze Martian surface structures. I fine-tuned the Idefics multimodal model (9B parameters) to detect and provide detailed information related to Martian images.</p>
        <p>The challenge here was to effectively combine both text and image data to train the model. I had to experiment with different techniques to ensure that the model could process both modalities in a meaningful way. This project required extensive knowledge of both computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), and it helped me deepen my understanding of multimodal deep learning.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Alzheimer’s Prediction using Graph Neural Network</h3>
        <p>For this project, I developed a 5-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model to predict Alzheimer’s stages using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. I converted the DTI data into a graph format and trained the GCN model to predict the stages of Alzheimer’s based on brain region connectivity matrices.</p>
        <p>The biggest challenge here was to efficiently work with the graph-based data and extract meaningful features from the connectivity matrices. Despite these challenges, I was able to achieve 47% accuracy, which was a strong foundation for further development in brain disease prediction using graph-based neural networks.</p>
